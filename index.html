    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div class="text-block">
      <p>We founded TAKUMI Inc. (store name JOLIJOU) with a simple mission: to share the best of Japan with the world. Under the guidance of our CEO, Shohei Okazaki, we deliver Japan’s unique strengths in high-quality reuse and recycling – along with the spirit of “mottainai” – to shoppers across the globe. In Japan, mottainai is a cherished concept that means “don’t let things go to waste.” It’s about deeply respecting the value of items, reducing waste, and giving quality goods a second life.</p>
      <p>Embracing this spirit, we also work hand-in-hand with our group’s disability support program. Through processes like expert bag repair and cleaning, we create meaningful employment opportunities, striving to build a sustainable society where everyone can contribute.</p>
      <p>By spreading this cycle of renewal and respect for resources, we hope to introduce people worldwide to a piece of Japanese culture – and in doing so, foster understanding and goodwill across borders. That is our vision.</p>

      <h3>Our 5 Promises to You</h3>
      <p>We take great pride in being a Japanese company, and we faithfully uphold our Five Promises to Our Customers:</p>
      <p>1. We never tolerate counterfeit products or unauthorized distribution under any circumstances.<br>
         2. We respond and ship promptly, ensuring our customers are never kept waiting.<br>
         3. We always keep our promises and stand by every commitment we make.<br>
         4. We strive to offer both affordability and quality, delivering products that achieve the best of both.<br>
         5. We approach every customer interaction with sincerity, honoring the Japanese spirit of omotenashi—genuine hospitality and care.</p>

      <h3>Authenticity Guarantee</h3>
      <p>You can shop with confidence at JOLIJOU. We source all our products from trusted AACD member suppliers (AACD is the Association Against Counterfeit Product Distribution in Japan, dedicated to eliminating fake goods). On top of that, our in-house team of experts – two specialists with over 10 years of industry experience each – rigorously inspects every item for authenticity. Only pieces that pass this strict dual-check are offered for sale.</p>
      <p>For even greater peace of mind, we can provide a third-party Certificate of Authenticity upon request. This service is available to any customer who wants independent verification of their purchase. Just let our staff know, and we’ll be happy to arrange it for you.</p>

      <h3>Returns Policy</h3>
      <p>In principle, all sales are final. However, your satisfaction and trust are our top priorities. If an item arrives with significant damage that wasn’t described (such as a stain or scratch we missed) or in the extremely unlikely event a counterfeit item slipped through, we will of course make it right. Please contact us in such cases, and once the item is returned, we will issue a full refund immediately.</p>

      <h3>How to Purchase</h3>
      <p>Ready to find your next treasure? Simply reach out to us via the link, WhatsApp, or Instagram. One of our friendly sales representatives will get back to you right away. We’ll share our product catalog and answer any questions you have. Whether you’re looking for something specific or just browsing, we’re here to help you every step of the way.</p>
      <p>We genuinely look forward to hearing from you and helping you discover the perfect piece. Thank you for considering JOLIJOU – we can’t wait to serve you!<br><br>
      <strong>Shohei Okazaki, CEO (TAKUMI Inc.)</strong></p>
